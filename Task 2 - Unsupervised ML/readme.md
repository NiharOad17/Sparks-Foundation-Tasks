This is my first task, In this I've made a Supervised Machine Learning Model using Simple Linear Regression. The development was done on Jupyter Notebook using Python 39 with the help of libraries such as : Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib & Scikit-Learn.

The files have been provided within the folder. The ipynb files can be opened with help of Jupyter Notebook/Lab. The data set used for this project has been uploaded with the name "Iris.csv"
